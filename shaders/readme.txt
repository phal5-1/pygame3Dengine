Created using moderngl(glsl based language).
You'd like to pip install this thing to review my code. You can use:

pip install moderngl

and no, conda install doesn't really work.

I didn't really have the IDE that could open this kind of a file, so I programmed in notepad.
It took a long, harsh time, and frankly, it's still taking a long, harsh time.

Please take into account that these files are basically a copy of a shader in a youtube tutorial,
so these don't really count as a 'self-developed engine'.
